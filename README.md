# .github

This is a special repository that allows proliferating a few [different supported file types](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types) such as a PR template and an issue template.

For example, since there is a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` in this repo, then if there is a repo that does not have this file, that repo will use the default PR template defined in this repo.
